Multiple-Index-Sums
===================

An article extending single index sums with combinatorial applications.

This is independent research. I myself have studied as a mathematician, but this particular work
is likely more interesting to a theoretical computing scientist.

The history of this work originates with another article of mine posted here on GitHub:

https://github.com/Daniel-Nikpayuk/Summation

that particular article was intended for an introductory audience and so I kept it pretty tame
focusing on single and double index sums, but even by the time I had written it (over ten years
ago now), I was working on the full-out multi-index version. What's uploaded here isn't actually
that version as I have recently reread it and found the writing (my writing) unworthy of posting.
As it was 22 pages long, I was not interested in a rewrite, and so I have instead wrote a condensed
version you see here.

Thank you.
