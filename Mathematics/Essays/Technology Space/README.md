Technology-Space
================

A quick picture book providing an intuitive explanation of the general concept of a Technology Space.

This is actually a concept I discovered/designed myself originally as a way of orienting my readings
of other programmer's manual pages. As there is no standard to writing man pages, I find it's a bit
of a Tower of Babel situation, and before this concept, I was always asking myself: "What is it this
person is trying to say about their app and how to interface with it?"

Although a serious presentation is not given here, I am finding this technology space concept more and
more useful in my professional life.
