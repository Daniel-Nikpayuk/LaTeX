Cognate-Theory
==============

A philosophical idea later to be pulled into a revised pedegogical narrative on combinatorics.

I will have several short (one-page) articles here on my GitHub account introducing nothing more than an idea,
but otherwise leaving as undeveloped.  One of my long run projects is to write a textbook on combinatorics which
provides an alternative pedegogical approach than what is currently taught with "permutations and combinations",
"select and choose" as I have never found this current approach intuitive. I'm taking the gamble that the reason
many people don't find combinatorics intuitive is that teachers are telling it wrong. They're not telling the good
stories. They're telling stories that are intuitive for only a small handful of young minds, whereas I believe we can
do better in general, and that there are more user-friendly pedegogical interfaces waiting to be found.

These small ideas I post here are for record keeping for myself as they are for me "pieces of the puzzle" which I will
combine together later when it's time to write my book. Years from now.

Thank you.
