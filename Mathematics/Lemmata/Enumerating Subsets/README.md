Enumerating-Subsets
===================

An informal article providing a small practical theorem on combinatorially enumerating fixed size subsets
of a given finite set, and in particular the construction of a bijection between each subset and its respective
natural number.

The result is only small research, and not anything cutting edge haha, but it's the sort of thing which might
come up now and again as a reference. As I didn't want to rederive it each time, I thought I'd post it here.

Thank you.
