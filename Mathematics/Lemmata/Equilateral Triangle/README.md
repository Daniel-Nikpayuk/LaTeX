Equilateral-Triangle
====================

An informal article providing a small practical theorem on cartesian coordinates of equilateral triangles.

The result is only small research, and not anything cutting edge haha, but it's the sort of thing which might
come up now and again as a reference. As I didn't want to rederive it each time, I thought I'd post it here.

Thank you.
