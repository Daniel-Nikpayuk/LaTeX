Tree-Traversal
==============

An informal article providing a small practical theorem on enumerating a tree data-structure by means of an
iterator.

Many such algorithms exist within the mainstream literature, each optimized for a particular constraint.
The approach I've taken is in using a space-optimized stack as iterator. Even this approach likely exists
in the literature, but as I have not found it, and I didn't know where else to look, I simply made it up here.

It's posted as a reference so I don't need to rederive it in the future.

Thank you.
